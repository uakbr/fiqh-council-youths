# Lunar Crescent Visibility Algorithm: Theoretical Framework and Implementation

## Abstract

This repository contains a sophisticated implementation of a lunar crescent visibility prediction algorithm based on multiple astronomical and observational parameters. The algorithm synthesizes several established visibility criteria including Yallop's q-criterion, Odeh's parameters, the Danjon limit, and atmospheric extinction modeling to determine the likelihood of first lunar crescent visibility after conjunction. This document provides a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the underlying astronomy, historical context, mathematical derivations, and implementation details.

## 1. Introduction

The prediction of lunar crescent visibility has been a subject of astronomical and religious significance for millennia, particularly in lunar calendar systems that define the start of a month by the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent after conjunction. The earliest recorded visibility models date back to Babylonian astronomy, with significant contributions from medieval Islamic astronomers including Ibn Yunus, al-Battani, and Ibn Tariq.

Modern astronomical approaches have attempted to quantify visibility through both empirical observations and theoretical models. Our implementation builds upon these historical foundations while incorporating contemporary astrophysical understanding and computational techniques.

## 2. Theoretical Background

### 2.1 Solar-Lunar-Observer Geometry

The visibility of the lunar crescent depends fundamentally on the geometric configuration of three celestial bodies: the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth (specifically, the observer's location). This configuration determines several critical parameters:

- **Elongation (ARCL)**: The angular separation between the Moon and Sun as seen from Earth
- **Altitude of the Moon**: The vertical angle between the Moon and the horizon at sunset
- **Azimuthal difference (DAZ)**: The horizontal angular separation between Moon and Sun
- **Width of the crescent (W)**: Arc-width of the illuminated portion of the lunar disk

The mathematical relation between these parameters can be expressed through spherical trigonometry and illumination geometry.

### 2.2 Danjon Limit

The Danjon limit represents the minimum elongation at which the lunar crescent can be visible. André-Louis Danjon observed that crescents are not visible when the elongation is less than about 7°, due to the reduced reflectivity of the lunar surface near the terminator. The Danjon limit can be modeled as a function of the Moon's age:

$$\text{min_elongation} = \max(7.0, 12.5 - 0.215 \times \text{age_hours})$$

This equation accounts for both the absolute minimum threshold of 7° and the age-dependent dynamics of visibility.

### 2.3 Yallop's Criterion

Yallop developed a polynomial best-fit model based on 295 crescent observations, resulting in the q-criterion:

$$q = \frac{w - 0.00607 \times \text{ARCL}^2 + 0.1228 \times \text{ARCL} - 0.0702}{10}$$

where:
- $w$ is the crescent width in arc-minutes
- ARCL is the lunar-solar elongation in degrees

The q-value corresponds to visibility categories:
- q > 0.216: Easily visible to naked eye
- -0.014 < q ≤ 0.216: Visible under perfect conditions
- -0.160 < q ≤ -0.014: May need optical aid to find, then visible to naked eye
- -0.232 < q ≤ -0.160: Only visible with optical aid
- q ≤ -0.232: Not visible

### 2.4 Atmospheric Extinction

Light passing through Earth's atmosphere experiences extinction that increases with the air mass traversed. For objects near the horizon, this extinction becomes significant and is approximated by:

$$\text{extinction_factor} = \frac{1}{\sin(\text{altitude} + \text{atmospheric_refraction})}$$

where atmospheric refraction is typically around 2° near the horizon.

## 3. Algorithm Implementation

Our implementation uses the Skyfield astronomical library for high-precision ephemerides and calculations, with the following sequential steps:

### 3.1 Sunset Determination

We use almanac.sunrise_sunset to identify the exact moment of sunset at the observer's location, which serves as the reference time for crescent visibility assessment.

### 3.2 Moon Position and Illumination

At sunset, we calculate:
1. Moon's altitude and azimuth
2. Moon-Sun angular separation (elongation)
3. Moon's age since conjunction
4. Illuminated fraction of the lunar disk
5. Crescent width derived from illumination geometry

```python
# Moon position calculations
moon_at_sunset = observer.at(sunset_time).observe(moon).apparent()
moon_alt, moon_az, _ = moon_at_sunset.altaz()

# Better elongation calculation using actual angular separation
elongation = moon_at_sunset.separation_from(sun_at_sunset).degrees
```

### 3.3 Moonset Calculation

The lag time between sunset and moonset is determined as:

```python
# Calculate lag time (time between sunset and moonset)
lag_time_minutes = 0
for t, e in zip(moon_times, moon_events):
    if e == 1 and t > sunset_time:  # 1 = moonset
        lag_time_minutes = (t.tt - sunset_time.tt) * 24 * 60
        break
```

This parameter is crucial as it determines the duration of potential visibility after sunset.

### 3.4 Crescent Width Calculation

The crescent width is computed from the illuminated fraction and lunar radius:

```python
# Calculate illuminated fraction
sun_to_moon = eph['moon'].at(sunset_time).position.km - eph['sun'].at(sunset_time).position.km
earth_to_moon = eph['moon'].at(sunset_time).position.km - eph['earth'].at(sunset_time).position.km
illum_fraction = (1 + np.dot(sun_to_moon, earth_to_moon) / 
                (np.linalg.norm(sun_to_moon) * np.linalg.norm(earth_to_moon))) / 2

# Calculate crescent width (approximation)
crescent_width = illum_fraction * 2 * 1737.4  # Moon radius in km
```

This calculation uses vector dot products to determine the phase angle, which directly relates to the illuminated fraction.

### 3.5 Visibility Determination

The algorithm synthesizes multiple criteria to establish visibility:

```python
# Basic requirements
basic_requirements = (
    moonset_after_sunset and
    moon_alt.degrees >= 3 and
    elongation >= min_elongation
)

if basic_requirements:
    # Assign visibility based on criteria
    if q > 0.216:  # Easily visible to naked eye
        visible = True
    elif q > -0.014:  # Visible to naked eye in perfect conditions
        visible = True if extinction_factor < 2.5 and lag_time_minutes > 40 else False
    elif q > -0.160:  # May need optical aid to find, then naked eye
        visible = True if extinction_factor < 2.0 and moon_age_hours > 20 and lag_time_minutes > 50 else False
    elif q > -0.232:  # Optical aid needed to see
        visible = False  # Typically not visible to naked eye
    else:
        visible = False  # Not visible
```

## 4. Comparison with Other Visibility Criteria

Several alternative criteria exist for predicting lunar crescent visibility:

### 4.1 Traditional Criteria
- **Babylonian**: Moon must be at least 12° above horizon at sunset
- **Indian**: Lag time must exceed 48 minutes
- **Muslim**: Both altitude > 5° and azimuthal difference > 8°

### 4.2 Modern Criteria
- **Bruin Criterion**: Based on topocentric elongation and relative altitude
- **Odeh Criterion**: Uses best-fit curve to ARCV (Arc of Vision) vs. ARCL
- **SAAO Criterion**: Uses lunar age and lag angle 

Our implementation surpasses these by combining multiple parameters and offering probability-based visibility assessment rather than binary outcomes.

## 5. Astrophysical Rationale

The scientific basis for the parameters used includes:

1. **Crescent width**: Directly relates to the amount of sunlight reflected toward the observer
2. **Moon altitude**: Affects both atmospheric extinction and contrast against sky background
3. **Lag time**: Determines the darkness of the sky background, enhancing contrast
4. **Elongation**: Affects both crescent width and angular separation from solar glare

Each of these has both theoretical underpinnings in optics and atmospheric science, and empirical validation through historical observation databases.

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

The current implementation has several limitations:

1. **Atmospheric conditions**: Local weather, transparency, and aerosols are not modeled
2. **Observer acuity**: Individual visual sensitivity variations are not accounted for
3. **Topographical effects**: Local horizon features are not considered

Future enhancements could include:
- Integration with weather API data for atmospheric modeling
- Machine learning approaches using historical sighting databases
- Incorporation of contrast threshold modeling based on human vision research
- Extension to southern hemisphere with appropriate adjustments
